# Data and scripts: How (not) to motivate online workers: Two controlled field experiments on leadership in the gig economy
### Sebastian Fest, Ola Kvaløy, Petra Nieken, Anja Schöttner

## Description

This project folder contains data and scripts to reproduce the results presented in the paper. 
Scripts are available as [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) and are stored in the notebook subfolder. 
You can directly open and read the scripts by clicking on them. If you want to work interactively with the project 
files, then you need to install all python dependencies that are listed in the requirements.txt file and 
clone this repository.
